        <p>
          In <time datetime="1920">1920</time>, the French demarcated the region
          of Lebanon. On <time datetime="11-22"> November 22nd</time> of that
          year, the region officially achieved independence becoming the
          Lebanese Republic. However, from <time datetime="1975">1975</time> to
          <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, the country underwent a civil war
          followed by years of social, political, and economic instability.
          Prior to the Lebanese Civil War, the country enjoyed a more
          diveresified economy fueled by tourism, agriculture, and commerce.
        </p>

        <p>
          Physically, Lebanon is about one-third the size of the state of
          Maryland, making it the smallest country in continental Asia and one
          of the smallest countries in the <em>world</em>. Located in the Middle
          East, Lebanon borders the Mediterranean Sea between Israel and Syria.
          Syria has historically been an influence on Lebanonâ€™s foreign and
          domestic policies with its military occupying the nation for almost 30
          years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lebanon's borders with Israel and Syria still remain unresolved. You

        <p>
          The capital of Lebanon is <b>Beirut</b>, a small peninsula whose city
          is bounded eastwards by the mountainous interior of the country. For
          over 5,000 years, Beirut has been an urban center and a focus of
          military and economic conflicts with its neighboring city-states.

        <p>
          Being located near the Mediterranean, Lebanon experiences mild to
          cool, wet winters with hot, dry summers. However, Lebanon also has
          mountain ranges that are known for heavy, winter snowstorms. Lebanon
          also can undergo natural hazards such as earthquakes, sandstorms, and
          dust storms.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for its terrain, Lebanon is home to a narrow coastal plain and El
          Beqaa (Bekaa Valley) which separates Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon
          Mountains. Lebanon's highest point of elevation is Qornet es Saouda at

        <h2>Government</h2>

        <p>
          The Lebanese Republic is a parliamentary republic, which means the
          government operates under a parliamentary system of government with an
          Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branch. Unlike the United States,
          you do not obtain Lebanese citizenship automatically by birth. In
          order to obtain citizenship via birth it is required that your father
          is a citizen of Lebanon.

        <h2>Elections/Appointments</h2>

        <p>
          The chief of state (president) is indirectly elected by the Lebanese
          National Assembly. The election requires two-thirds majority vote in
          the first round. If needed, absolute majority vote is required for a
          second-round voting on a 6-year term.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last election was held on
          <time datetime="2016-10">October of 2016</time> with the next election
          to be held sometime in <time datetime="2022">2022</time>. Once
          elected, the president then appoints a Prime Minister in consultation
          with the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is then responsible for
          choosing a cabinet in consultation with the president and National
          Assembly. A deputy prime minister is chosen during the formation of
          the cabinet.
