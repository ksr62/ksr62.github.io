    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p> Welcome to my very first webpage! Here, you can learn a little bit about me and follow along as I embark on my coding journey!</p>

      <h2>About Me!</h2>

      <p>Hello, my name is Kaylin Ranges. I am a senior at the Univeristy of Miami majoring in Marketing with a minor in Creative Advertising. Although my studies mainly focus on the business and analytics side of markeitng, I <em>truly</em> have a passion for the creative side of the industry and <em>love</em> to explore it whenever I can. Outside of school, I am originally from New Jersey and have a house at the Jersey Shore.</p>

      <p> I have been going to the Jersey Shore every summer since I was three years old. Originally, my grandparents had a little condo on the water in Point Pleasant Beach. However, when I was six we moved to Normandy Beach and built what is now my current beach house. All my favorite people and places are in Normandy Beach and I can't wait to return each summer.</p>

      <p> With my love for the beach came my interest in photography which ultimately led to my decision to choose advertising as my minor. I love going out with friends and capturing any moment I can with either my iPhone, a disposable camera, or my film camera! My favorite model however is my 1 year old mini labradoodle, Addy!</p>
