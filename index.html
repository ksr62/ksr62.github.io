        <h2>Hi, I'm Kaylin!</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring copywriter who loves to utilize my business
          background to solve logical problems with creative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to refer to myself as an artist in the business world, if you
          will.
        </p>
        <p>
          So sit back, relax, and take a peek at some cool projects I have

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As you browse through my work, Iâ€™d like to tell you a little bit more
          about me and my background as a copywriter. Like most people in the
          industry, I happened to stumble across copywriting. I originally came
          to college a marketing major wanting to pursue digital and social
          media marketing with a focus on analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of measuring the metrics of a campaign excited yet scared
          me as I believed it to be a very math heavy field. However, upon
          taking a deep dive into digital analytics, I found a hidden knack.
          Being able to combine this background in business with my ability as a
          creative writer has presented many opportunities for me to explore the
          creative side of marketing and advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since discovering this passion, I have spent the majority of my senior
          year taking on as many classes and projects as I can in order to
          express and fine tune my creative talents. While I still have a way to
          go, I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish and am excited
          for what the future holds. I hope you enjoy my work and be on the
          lookout for more!

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
          This is work from a old D&amp;AD creative brief. The brief asked
          participants to connect a brand to technology to create something not
          possible or thought of 3 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          After sitting down with the brief and brainstorming for quite
          sometime, my partner and I came up with the idea of UnHinged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially it is the breakup mode made to be turned off from the
          dating app designed to be deleted. We thought if Hinge's Noble-Prize
          winning algorithim can help pair you with your perfect match, then it
          can help you find a breakup buddy too.
