        <h2>Chivas Regal Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Chivas Regal tasked us with creating the blended Scotch Whiskey of
          tomorrow for the next generation of hustlers.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was vital to the brief that we considered the product concept,
          packaging and identiy, as well as product launch all while making our
          bottle a status symbol.
        </p>

        <p>
          And thus, Chivas Regal XIX was born, a perfect blend of sweet and
          smoky that embodies the forgotten generation of Hyrbid Hustler's
          success.

        <h3>Chivas Regal Commercial Script</h3>
        <p>
          It took a global pandemic to shed a light on this forgotten generation
          of hustlers. The ones who telecommunicated for reasons far related to
          a pandemic. The ones who did it <em>just</em> to prove it could be
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          No time is unprecedented for these pioneers. They brought Wall Street
          to their street before the world knew it to be possible. They are
          trailblazers. Innovators. Visionaries. They are
          <em>hybrid hustlers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, we crafted a blend to celebrate them Introducing Chivas Regal
          XIX, infused with the aromatic notes of vanilla and honeyed apples,
          topped with a mellow smokiness to give our hustlers a luxuriously,
          long finish. Sweet and smoky, the perfect hybrid to embody our
          hustlers’ success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crafted with blended whiskies originating from distilleries no longer
          in existence, Chivas Regal XIX is a success sought after. Designed to
          adorn every office, everywhere and provide the perfect sip to clock
          out the day. So let your bottle become a mark of grandeur and cheers
          to the ones who kept the good times rolling.

        <h2>Connect4Climate Brief</h2>
        <p>
          This work is also from a previous D&amp;AD Creative Brief for
          Connect4Climate where we were asked to create a guerrilla marketing
          campaign that encourages sports fans to take action against climate
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          My partner and I had the idea to take AR technology currently being
          used in college football stadiums to "flood" Hard Rock Stadium, home
          of the Miami Hurricanes. This Flooded Fields Campaign is intended to
          spark conversation and encourage fans to take action to protect the
          fate of college football and our future.
        </p>

        <h3>Connect4Climate Execution Copy</h3>
        <p>
          What if we provided fans with a mixed-reality experience highlighting
          how the fate of college football is not in the distant future, but
          instead much closer than we think? Using augmented reality with live
          rendition videos, we will flood Hard Rock Stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the Miami Hurricanes rush the field, fans will be advised via a
          video on the jumbotron to take out their phones, turn on their camera,
          and point it in the direction of the team tunnel. The stadium lights
          will flicker, flood sirens will wail, and the Miami Hurricanes will
          emerge from AR flood waters to Kiss’ “All Hell’s Breakin Loose” in
          order to save the Miami Hurricanes and Hard Rock Stadium, fans will be
          encouraged to donate to a link embedded in the Sport4Climate website
          that will appear on their phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more fans donate, the more the flood waters will recede. Fans can
          watch the progression of the flood at any point in the game by pulling
          out their phones and activating their cameras.
